\section{Score}

\subsection{Facts}

\begin{dashed}
    \item The points that you score for a match are determined by the type of win you achieve.
    \item A normal win requires you bear off all your chips, or that the other player concedes. This    awards one point
    \item A Gammon win requires you win before the other player manages to bear off any chips. This awards 2 points
    \item A Backgammon requires you meet the prior requirements and the enemy player still has chips on your home quadrant or the bar. This awards 3 points.
    \item The points you are awarded are multiplied by the value of the doubling cube.
\end{dashed}

\subsection{Summary}
The doubling cube is a multiplier that determines the number of points awarded
to the winner at the end of a game.

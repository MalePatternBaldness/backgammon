\section{Chip}

\subsection{Facts}
\begin{itemize} [itemsep=2pt,parsep=2pt]
    \item Can be either black or red.
    \item Chips move clockwise around the board to their Home Board.
    \item A single chip of either colour belongs to each player.
    \item The chip belonging to the player is referenced 15 times.

\subsection{Attribute}
\begin{itemize} [itemsep=2pt,parsep=2pt]
    \item colour
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Behaviour}
\begin{itemize} [itemsep=2pt,parsep=2pt]
    \item getColour
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Collaborations}
\begin{itemize} [itemsep=2pt,parsep=2pt]
    \item Co-operates with board to determine chip locations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary}
Due to the need to keep track of the chip location, a method maybe needed to update how many chips
are on a pointer.

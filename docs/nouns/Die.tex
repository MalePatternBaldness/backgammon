\subsection{Facts}

\begin{dashed}
    \item There are two die in play in a game.
    \item At the start of the game, both players roll to determine who goes first.
    The player with the higher roll plays first, and the dice are re-rolled if equal.
    \item Players move their chips according to the rolls on their dice.
    E.g Player rolls 2,5 he can choose to move one piece up 2, and another up 5,
    or one piece for a combined movement of 7 points.
    \item If the player rolls the same number on both dice, he "gets doubles", which
    allows him to play each die twice.
    E.g Player rolls 6,6 now he has 4 sixes that he can play.

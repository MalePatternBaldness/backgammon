\chapter{Introduction}

This is an initial draft for a CPSC 101 for the Winter 2022 semester by Team Java
with Joseph Diza as the lead author and developer. 

This document gives a quick \& extremely simplified overview
of the actual API and design of the Backgammon game.

\chapter{Noun Entries}

\section{Die}

\subsection{Facts}

%\begin{itemize}[label=\textendash, nosep]
\begin{dashed}
    \item There are two die in play in a game.
    \item At the start of the game, both players roll to determine who goes first.
The player with the higher roll plays first, and the dice are re-rolled if equal.
    \item Players move their chips according to the rolls on their dice.
        E.g Player rolls 2,5 he can choose to move one piece up 2, and another up 5,
        or one piece for a combined movement of 7 points.
    \item If the player rolls the same number on both dice, he "gets doubles", which
        allows him to play each die twice.
        E.g Player rolls 6,6 now he has 4 sixes that he can play.
    
\end{dashed}
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary}

A single Die does not contain much information to warrant becoming a class (the
only useful method for a single Die would be to generate a random integer).

\section{Doubling Cube}

\subection{Facts}
\begin{dashed}
\item The doubling cube is a multiplier that increases the number of points won by the player
    at the end of the game.
\end{dashed}

\subection{Summary}

\section{Point}

%\begin{itemize}[label=\textendash, nosep]
\begin{dashed}
    \item There are 24 points total on the board.
    \item Every point can hold 6 checkers.
    \item There are 12 points on the outer board, and 12 on the home board.
    \item A checker may only move to a point if it is open (contains < 2 opponents chips
        or < 6 of the player's chips)
\end{dashed}
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary}

A point at the very least needs to be some kind of container that has the ability
to store checkers. It also needs to determine how many checkers are on a point.

\section{Player}

\begin{dashed}
    \item There are two players in a game.
    \item The player can make a series of moves
\end{dashed}
